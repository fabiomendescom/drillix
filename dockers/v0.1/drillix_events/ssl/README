This docker will process some REST items for event entry.
This will eventually be a microservice that will handle the following:
1. Receive the request
2. Authenticated with bearer tokens
3. Deliver the request into an SNS topic
4. The SNS topic will be configured to write to SQS queues that will be
picked up by other processes
